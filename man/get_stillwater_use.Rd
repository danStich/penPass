\title{Get probability of fish using Stillwater Branch}
\usage{
get_stillwater_use(flow)
}
\arguments{
\item{flow}{A numeric vector containing flow (cfs) at USGS gage 01034500}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with probability that fish use Stillwater Branch
}
\description{
Get flow-conditional probability of fish using the Stillwater
Branch during downstream migration around Marsh Island in the lower Penobscot
River.
}
\examples{
# Simulate probability of using Stillwater Branch
# based on randomly drawn flow at West Enfield Dam
flow_cfs <- rep(seq(0, 60000, 100), 5)
flow_cms <- flow_cfs * 0.028316847
use <- get_stillwater_use(flow_cfs)
plot(flow_cms, use)
