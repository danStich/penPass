\title{Get dam-specific survival rates}
\usage{
get_annual_flows(year = 2020)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_or_old}{A character string indicating whether to use `"new"` 
(Amaral et al. 2012, Nieland and Sheehan 2020) or `"old"` (Amaral et al. 2012, 
Nieland et al. 2020) flow-correlated probabilities of p_stillwater as well 
as flow-correlated survival at `milford`, `orono`, and `stillwater` dams.}
}
\value{
A vector with dam passage rates
}
\description{
Get correlated dam-specific downstream survival rates for 
smolts at each dam from built-in `downstream_` datasets or default values
based on triangular distribution. Values based on Amaral et al. (2012) and 
sampled following Nieland et al. (2013, 2015) and Nieland and Sheehan (2020),
or sampled using `EnvStats::rtri()` for other dams based on Stevens et al. 
(2019).
